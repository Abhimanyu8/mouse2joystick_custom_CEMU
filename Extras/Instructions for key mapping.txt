Do not change the layout in CEMU AT ALL from the imported one.

If you want to change your keys, change the order of the keylist in mouse2joystick. Use the helper Excel file, it should hopefully be self explanatory.
 Just right click the joystick in the bottom right taskbar and click settings and choose Mouse2Joystick->Keys and paste the list there.

To change the Movement keys change the settings under KeyboardMovement->Keys

* Make sure you don't use any keys for movement that are already in the remapping list. It will cause strange behaviour when pressed.
