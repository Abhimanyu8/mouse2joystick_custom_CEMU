# mouse2joystick_custom_CEMU
I've decided to combine my customizations into a single script to be easier to manage.

Copy Pasted from there:

## You still must install [vJoy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/files/latest/download) in order for this to work, however you no longer need to install [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe) unless you download the non-compiled version.

# Initial Setup
***
* After you install vJoy you must run the [vJoy Configuration](http://i.imgur.com/5YBbtgA.png) and set it up so it has at least 17 Buttons, as you can see I set 32.

&nbsp;

* Then open CEMU and goto the input settings.
* Choose the type of controller you want to use, either 'Pro' or 'GamePad'.
* Make sure to choose the device as vJoy.
* Now you can import the layouts I've included, the 'ccc' files in the zip.  I've exported and included layouts for both GamePad and Pro controller.
* The input setup should look [like this](http://i.imgur.com/zJlASOK.png), if you chose 'Pro' it should be the same, but there won't be a 'blow mic' button.
  * Note the device is set to **vJoy NOT Keyboard**.

### If it doesn't look like this, you are going to have a problem, and you can try the following to fix the issue at this step:

- [Check this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/5zn0xa/autohotkey_script_to_use_mouse_for_camera/dgnq6lj/) for a guide on how to manually map the keys if you have import issues. Thank you /u/tacochops!

- Also you can try [running this script](https://bitbucket.org/CemuUser8/files/downloads/CEMU_Auto_vJoy_Mapper.zip) I made for auto re-mapping vJoy in the Input settings. It will ask you to open CEMU input settings, then ask you to set the device to vJoy if it isn't already, then let you know the detected type of controller (GamePad or Pro) and then automatically click through and set the buttons to the same as what the 'ccc' file should've imported. I've tested this over and over on my machine and it works, however so does importing the 'ccc' file, so who knows it might not work either.
**You must close the main script as it interferes with the mapping**

# Using the Script and changing the key mapping
***
##
At this point the script should work with the default keys and options I had set. However I recommend you customize the keys and sensitivity settings to your personal preference. 

* Press `F1` to toggle activation when running. It should automatically move the mouse and capture it to control the camera, if CEMU isn't running you will probably get an error pop-up. This key can be changed under ['General->Hotkeys'](http://i.imgur.com/DgQfU1n.png)

&nbsp;

* You open the script settings by right clicking on the [controller icon in your system tray](http://i.imgur.com/gYsabLx.png) (Bottom Right) and choosing 'settings'

&nbsp;

* To change your movement keys open script settings, and set the Keys under ['KeyboardMovement->Keys'](http://i.imgur.com/4NMjrRA.png), this is also where the toggle to walk key is set.

&nbsp;

* To change all other keys all you need to do is update the KeyList under[ 'Mouse2Joystick->Keys'](http://i.imgur.com/ABinaii.png), I've included an excel [Helper File](http://i.imgur.com/0kE56XJ.png) that should make it easy to generate the keys. Make sure you don't use whatever keys you have set up for movement as a button key.

  * Look at [my layout](http://i.imgur.com/zJlASOK.png) and you'll see it that every key is assigned a button, and then if you look at [my helper file](http://i.imgur.com/0kE56XJ.png) you will see that it has the Button numbers and which Wii U key it is assigned to, you can then change the **Keyboard Key** column to whatever you want (Special keys, like mouse buttons, [must in in valid format](https://autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm)) you then take the generated KeyList from the middle and [paste it into the script.](http://i.imgur.com/ABinaii.png)
